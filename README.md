# Mobile Money and Stripe Payment Core
<p>
This is a server side helper repository for mobile money payment, which supports Stripe, Tigo Pesa and M-Pesa payments for now. For M-Pesa payments we have used wazoHub as our aggregator.

<p>
Since, Mobile Network Operators need to white list your server's IP address then it is important to have this on your server side for handshaking during payment authorization.
